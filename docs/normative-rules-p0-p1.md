# Luna 0.1 — retained normative language rules A–K

## Status: retained adopted contracts; current conformance tracked separately

Language baseline: [Luna 0.1](spec/0.1/README.md). Prior freeze decisions remain contract history, not a blanket certification of the current implementation. See [gaps](spec/0.1/gaps.md).
**Context**: Finalized following *Luna Language Semantic Audit (Specification-Level)*.
**Purpose**: Establish four foundational, mathematically sound normative rules to serve as the unshakeable source of truth for the Luna type system, borrow checker, and compiler architecture.

---

## Rule A: Mutual Exclusivity of `Copy` and `Drop` (P0)

### A.1 Core Invariant
$$\forall T \in \text{ConcreteTypes}, \quad \neg (\text{satisfies}(T, \text{Copy}) \land \text{satisfies}(T, \text{Drop}))$$

A concrete type cannot satisfy both `Copy` and `Drop`.

### A.2 Rationale
`Copy` guarantees that bitwise duplication of a value's memory footprint produces a distinct, fully independent instance without lifecycle hooks. `Drop` guarantees that a value owns resources requiring custom finalization logic executed upon scope exit. Permitting a concrete type to satisfy both creates an irreconcilable soundness paradox: bitwise copying duplicates the instance without invoking lifecycle hooks, leading to guaranteed double-free or resource corruption when the destructor executes on multiple bitwise copies.

### A.3 Enforcement Paths
1. **Direct Implementation**:
   - Given `impl Drop for T`, any declaration `impl Copy for T` (or vice-versa) is a static compile-time error (`E_COPY_DROP_CONFLICT`).
2. **Derived Implementation**:
   - `#[derive(Copy)]` on a struct or enum is rejected if the type itself implements `Drop`.
3. **Transitive Field Constraints**:
   - A composite type (struct, enum, tuple) cannot satisfy or derive `Copy` if any transitive field $f_i$ satisfies `Drop`.
4. **Separation from Generic Bounds**:
   - The invariant applies strictly to **concrete types**.
   - A generic bound such as `fn foo<T: Copy + Drop>(x: T)` specifies an impossible constraint for any valid Luna type. Whether the compiler rejects this bound at definition-time (via an optional bound-consistency checker) or at instantiation-time (when no concrete type can satisfy both) is a diagnostic design choice, and does not alter the core invariant.

---

## Rule B: Prohibition of Subplace Moves under `Drop` (P0)

### B.1 Core Invariant
$$\forall \text{Place } p, \forall \text{Place } a \text{ such that } a \sqsubset p, \quad \text{satisfies}(\text{typeof}(a), \text{Drop}) \implies \neg\text{can\_move}(p)$$

A proper subplace of a `Drop` place cannot be moved out. Whole-place move remains legal.

### B.2 Rationale
When a place $a$ of a type implementing `Drop` goes out of scope, the destructor hook `Drop::drop(&rw a)` must execute on a fully valid, fully initialized memory place. Moving a proper subplace $p = a.\text{field}$ leaves $a$ in a partially deinitialized state. Invoking `Drop::drop` on a partially deinitialized struct causes undefined behavior.

### B.3 Place Semantics
1. **Proper Subplace Move**:
   - Given a place $c$ whose type satisfies `Drop`: evaluating `move c.field` (by variable binding, function argument, or pattern match) is **strictly forbidden** (`E_PARTIAL_MOVE_UNDER_DROP`).
2. **Hierarchical Propagation**:
   - If $a \sqsubset p$ (i.e., $a$ is any strict prefix or ancestor place of $p$) and $\text{typeof}(a)$ satisfies `Drop`, moving $p$ is forbidden.
3. **Whole-Place Move**:
   - Moving the entire container $c$ (`dec a = c;`) transfers full ownership of all fields and shifts the destructor obligation to the new binding. **Whole-place move is fully permitted.**
4. **Field Borrowing**:
   - Borrowing a subplace (`&c.field` or `&rw c.field`) does not deinitialize the container. It is **fully permitted** under normal non-lexical borrow check rules.
5. **Field Reassignment / Overwrite**:
   - Evaluating `c.field = new_value;` on an already-initialized container $c$ does not produce a partially moved state. The previous field value is dropped in-place and replaced with `new_value`. The container $c$ remains fully initialized. **Field assignment is fully permitted.**

---

## Rule C: Associated Type Projections & The Monomorphization Barrier (P0)

### C.1 Core Invariant
Associated type projections may remain symbolic during generic semantic analysis, but no unresolved projection may cross the monomorphization boundary into MVIR and backend code generation.

### C.2 Rationale
During generic typechecking and constraint solving, associated types (such as `<T as Try>::Output` or `<T as Try>::Residual`) cannot always be normalized immediately because the concrete type argument for `T` is unknown. Demanding premature normalization before borrow checking would cripple generic analysis. However, downstream phases (monomorphic MVIR lowering, memory layout calculation, LLVM code generation) require completely concrete types.

### C.3 Phase-by-Phase Lifecycle
```

                                       zero GenericParam, and zero InferenceVar allowed.
```

### C.4 Soundness of the `Try` Protocol
For the desugaring of `val?`:
1. In a generic function with `T: Try`, the branch return type is symbolically `<T as Try>::Residual` and `<T as Try>::Output`.
2. The caller return constraint is unified: $\text{ReturnType} : \text{FromResidual}<<T \text{ as Try}>::\text{Residual}>$.
3. Upon monomorphization with concrete type $T = \text{Result}<i32, \text{Error}>$, the projections normalize to:
   - `<T as Try>::Output` $\longrightarrow i32$
   - `<T as Try>::Residual` $\longrightarrow \text{Result}<\text{Infallible}, \text{Error}>$
4. Full type soundness is verified prior to MVIR emission.

---

## Rule D: Trait Coherence & The Nominal Head Orphan Rule (P1)

### D.1 Core Invariant
$$\forall (\text{Trait}, \text{Type}) \text{ in program}, \quad \text{applicable\_impls}(\text{Trait}, \text{Type}) \le 1$$

For every canonical $(\text{Trait}, \text{Type})$ pair in a program, there is at most one applicable implementation.

**Overlap Invariant**: Two `impl` declarations are illegal if their canonical trait and self-type patterns can unify (i.e., coherence is checked over unifiable pattern overlap, not merely syntactic equality).

### D.2 The Nominal Head Orphan Rule
An implementation `impl<...> Trait for TargetType` is legal within provider $P$ if and only if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:

$$\text{is\_declared\_in}(Trait, P) \lor \text{is\_declared\_in}(\text{nominal\_head}(TargetType), P)$$

1. **Local Trait**: The `Trait` is declared within provider $P$.
2. **Local Nominal Head Type**: The root constructor (nominal head) of `TargetType` is declared within provider $P$.

*Note: The compiler strictly checks the nominal head constructor of the Self type. It does NOT inspect generic arguments to discover nested local types.*

### D.3 Precise Matrix for Generic Wrappers

| Implementation Declaration | Provider of Nominal Head | Provider of Inner Type / Generic Param | Legal in Provider $P$? | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `impl<T> ExternalTrait for LocalWrapper<T>` | Local ($P$) | External / Generic | **YES** | `LocalWrapper` is the local nominal head. |
| `impl<T> ExternalTrait for ExternalWrapper<LocalType>` | External | Local ($P$) | **NO (REJECT)** | Nominal head `ExternalWrapper` is external. |
| `impl<T> ExternalTrait for ExternalWrapper<T>` | External | Generic Param | **NO (REJECT)** | Nominal head `ExternalWrapper` is external. |
| `impl ExternalTrait for ExternalType` | External | External | **NO (REJECT)** | Pure orphan implementation. Strictly forbidden. |

### D.4 Consequence for Language Extensibility
* A user cannot write `impl Try for i32` or `impl Drop for String` because neither the trait nor the nominal type head is local.
* A user can write `impl Try for MyResult<T, E>` because `MyResult` is a local nominal type.
* Fundamental types (such as `&T`, `*T`, `rw T`) will be governed by a separate *Fundamental Type Semantics* specification and do not alter this base rule.
* This guarantees that independent packages can be compiled and linked together without silent implementation collisions or coherence breakdowns.

## Rule E: Asynchronous Borrow Invariant & Future Storage (P1-B)

### E.1 Core Invariant
$$\forall \text{Future } F, \forall \text{Place } p, q \in \text{Env}(F), \quad \neg (\text{points\_to}(p, q))$$

1. **Prohibition of Self-Referential Futures**: No place or reference within an async state machine's environment (`EnvStruct`) may point to another place within the same future instance (`LocalLoan`).
2. **External Borrow Provenance**: A reference parameter or borrowed place crossing an await point is sound if and only if its lifetime/provenance originates from outside the future (`FutureLoan`).
3. **Future Loan Lifecycle**:
   - A `FutureLoan` attached to a future remains active while the future place/value is live under NLL.
   - Moving a future (`fut1 -> fut2`) transfers the `FutureLoan` obligation and provenance to `fut2`.
   - When the future terminates (via normal completion / consumption `fut.await`, explicit destruction `drop(fut)`, or scope exit), the loan terminates.

---

## Rule F: Async × Drop & State-Dispatched Cancellation (P1-C)

### F.1 Core Invariant
$$\forall T, \quad \text{needs\_drop}(\text{Future}<T>) = \text{true}$$

Every Luna `Future<T>` owns a runtime execution environment (`EnvStruct`) whose destruction requires a specialized future destructor `{func}_drop`, regardless of whether $T$ implements `Drop`.

### F.2 State-Dispatched Cleanup Protocol
Future destruction is dispatched based on the dynamic state discriminant stored in the environment:
1. **`Initial` (State 0)**:
   - Drops only owned places that are initialized and live at cancellation time (function parameters and pre-await initializations).
   - Branches directly to `free_env`.
2. **`Suspended(k)` (State $k > 0$)**:
   - **Child Future Cancellation Cascade**: Checks if the active child future pointer in `env` is non-null (`child != null`), and if so, recursively invokes its specialized future destructor (`{child}_drop`).
   - **State-Specific Drop Set**: Drops all owned places belonging to:
     $$\text{DropSet}(k) = \text{LiveAt}(k) \cap \text{InitializedAt}(k) \cap \text{OwnedAt}(k) \cap \neg\text{MovedAt}(k)$$
   - Branches to `free_env`.
3. **`Completed` (State -1, `FUTURE_STATE_COMPLETED`)**:
   - All owned locals and child futures have already finalized during normal execution.
   - Destructor fast-paths directly to `free_env` without double-dropping.
4. **`Poisoned` (State -2, `FUTURE_STATE_POISONED`)**:
   - Reserved; not routed to `free_env` to prevent silent resource leaks without a formal poison unwinding specification.

### F.3 Ownership Transfer on Future Move
Future values obey standard affine move semantics:
- Moving `fut1` into `fut2` transfers the single destruction obligation to `fut2`.
- The source place `fut1` is deinitialized; borrowck eliminates redundant drops on `fut1`.
- Cancellation or scope exit guarantees exactly one destructor execution for the active future instance.

### F.4 Completion vs Cancellation Separation
- **Normal Completion**: The future state transitions to `FUTURE_STATE_COMPLETED` (-1), all local variables are dropped at their respective lexical scope exits in the resume function, and `env.child_future` is nullified.
- **Cancellation**: Invoked via `{func}_drop` while in state $k \ge 0$. It queries the state, conditionally frees the active child future, cleans up precisely $\text{DropSet}(k)$, and deallocates the environment.

---

## Rule G: Const × Comptime & Compile-Time Evaluation Boundary (P2-A)

### G.1 Core Invariant & Phase Separation
$$\text{Phase}(\text{Runtime}) \cap \text{Phase}(\text{Comptime}) = \emptyset$$
$$\forall v \in \text{ComptimeValue}, \quad \text{escapes\_to\_runtime}(v) \implies \text{is\_representable}(v) \land \neg\text{points\_to\_vm\_memory}(v)$$

1. **Strict Phase Separation**: Compile-time evaluation and runtime execution are strictly disjoint phases. The compiler shall never defer a failed or unsupported compile-time operation to runtime execution.
2. **Zero Fallback**: Any failure during compile-time evaluation (arithmetic overflow, division by zero, resource escape, dependency cycle, step limit exhaustion) must result in a fatal compile-time diagnostic.

### G.2 Unified Execution Engine with Dual Admission Channels
Execution is unified on MVIR via `MvirInterpreter`:
```
const Expr ─────────► [is_const_evaluable check] ──────┐
                                                       │
                                                       ▼
comptime { Expr } ──► [effect containment check] ──► MVIR ──► MvirInterpreter ──► ComptimeValue
```

1. **`const` Expression Admission (`is_const_evaluable`)**:
   - A `const` expression is a restricted, expression-oriented subset: deterministic, pure, non-mutating, non-allocating.
   - Permitted: arithmetic, comparisons, bitwise ops, primitive casts, pure aggregate constructors, scalar field/index projections, `sizeof`, `alignof`, and references to other `const` items.
   - Prohibited in raw `const`: loops, local mutable bindings (`dec rw`), assignments, and heap allocations.
   - **Encapsulated Computation**: If loops or local mutation are required to compute a constant, they must be explicitly encapsulated in an embedded `comptime { ... }` block:
     `const X: T = comptime { ... };` is legal if and only if the block satisfies comptime admission and the resulting value is a representable constant.
2. **`comptime` Block Admission (Effect Containment)**:
   - A `comptime { ... }` block executes within a compiler-owned VM sandbox.
   - Permitted: local mutable state (`dec rw`), imperative control flow (`while`, `for`, `loop`, `if`, `match`, `break`, `continue`), local heap structures, moves, drops, and pure function calls.
   - Effect containment: The block must have zero observable external side-effects. Prohibited: I/O, network access, async `await`, calling `extern fn`, and OS/thread interactions.

### G.3 Const Dependency Graph & Cycle Detection
- Declarations of `const` items (both module-level and local) are evaluated according to a topological dependency order.
- Cyclic dependencies (e.g. `const A = B + 1; const B = A + 1;`) are detected on the item dependency graph before evaluation and rejected with `E_CONST_DEPENDENCY_CYCLE`. Cyclic evaluation must never lead to compiler stack overflow.

### G.4 VM Memory Isolation & Runtime-Observable Resource Escape
$$\text{VM Memory} \not\longrightarrow \text{Runtime}$$
$$\text{VM Value} \longrightarrow \text{Runtime Materialization} \longrightarrow \text{Runtime-Owned Representation}$$

1. **Resource Escape Invariant**: No VM-allocated memory or host-bound resource may escape across the compile-time boundary into runtime code (`E_COMPTIME_RESOURCE_ESCAPE`).
2. **Prohibited Escapes**:
   - VM stack pointers (`Address::Stack`, `&T`)
   - Raw VM heap pointers (`Address::Heap`, `*T`)
   - Closures capturing VM environments
   - Unawaited futures
   - Opaque host handles or runtime-opaque types
3. **Runtime Materialization**:
   - Compile-time values (`ComptimeValue`) crossing into runtime are transformed into runtime-owned representations:
     - Primitives (`Int`, `Float`, `Bool`, `Char`) are materialized as immediate SSA operands.
     - Large aggregates, strings, and constant arrays are materialized into runtime-owned immutable storage (e.g. `.rodata` global sections), producing runtime-valid references. At no point does a runtime pointer reference internal VM memory.

### G.5 Affine Ownership, Moves, and Drops in the VM
- Memory slots in the VM maintain affine states: `Uninitialized`, `Initialized`, `Moved`.
- Reading a moved slot triggers `E_USE_OF_MOVED_VALUE`.
- Scope exits in the VM invoke drop functions for initialized places implementing `Drop`. Moved places are skipped, preventing double-frees at compile-time.
- Unfreed VM heap allocations at `comptime` block termination emit `E_COMPTIME_RESOURCE_LEAK`.

### G.6 Configurable Execution Boundaries
- The compile-time VM enforces an execution step limit (default: 1,000,000 steps) and a call recursion limit (default: 512 frames), configurable via compiler options (`--comptime-steps`, `--comptime-depth`).
- Exceeding these limits is a fatal diagnostic (`E_COMPTIME_STEP_LIMIT`, `E_COMPTIME_RECURSION_LIMIT`), never a runtime fallback.

---

## Rule H: Raw Pointer Safety & Unsafe Boundary (P2-B)

### H.1 Core Invariant: Separation of References and Raw Pointers
$$\forall p \in \text{PointerTypes}, \quad p \in \text{Reference}(\&T, \&\text{rw } T) \iff \text{Tracked}(\text{Lifetime}, \text{Provenance})$$
$$\forall p \in \text{PointerTypes}, \quad p \in \text{RawPointer}(*T, *\text{rw } T) \iff \neg\text{Tracked}(\text{Lifetime}, \text{Provenance}) \land \text{RequiresCapability}(*p, \text{UnsafeContext})$$

1. **References (`&T`, `&rw T`)**: Safe, compiler-tracked lifetimes and provenance. Dereferencing is fully safe.
2. **Raw Pointers (`*T`, `*rw T`)**: Second-class untracked addresses, `Copy` by default, carrying zero lifetime or provenance guarantees.
3. **Capability Boundary**: Dereferencing a raw pointer (`*p`), performing raw pointer arithmetic (`p + n`, `p - q`), and calling an `unsafe fn` (direct or indirect) strictly require an enclosing `unsafe` context (`unsafe { ... }` block or `unsafe fn` body). Any violation emits `E_UNSAFE_DEREF_OUTSIDE_UNSAFE`, `E_POINTER_ARITHMETIC_OUTSIDE_UNSAFE`, or `E_CALL_UNSAFE_FN_OUTSIDE_UNSAFE`.

### H.2 Model B Pointer Passing: Safe Creation, Copying, and Passing
- Creating a raw pointer from a reference (`&x as *T`, `&rw x as *rw T`), assigning/copying raw pointers (`dec q = p;`), and passing raw pointers as arguments or return values across safe function boundaries are **safe operations**.
- The act of holding or transmitting a raw pointer does not risk undefined behavior; only the capability-demanding operations (dereference, arithmetic, and unsafe calls) require `unsafe`.

### H.3 `unsafe` Is an Admission Boundary, NOT a Borrowck Bypass
$$\text{InUnsafeContext} \not\implies \text{BypassBorrowck}$$
1. Entering an `unsafe` block or `unsafe fn` grants admission to raw dereferences, pointer arithmetic, and unsafe function calls.
2. Standard borrowck, move analysis, and affine lifetime invariants remain 100% active inside `unsafe` for all safe places and references:
   - Mutating a safe place while an active shared reference exists inside an `unsafe` block is rejected with `E_BORROW_CONFLICT`.
   - Using a moved value inside an `unsafe` block is rejected with `E_USE_OF_MOVED_VALUE`.

### H.4 Access Mutability vs Object Mutability
- `*T` grants **read-only access capability** through that pointer, rather than asserting that the underlying target allocation is immutable.
- Writing through an immutable pointer (`*p = val`) or taking a mutable reference through it (`&rw (*p)`) is statically forbidden with `E_CANNOT_MUTATE_IMMUTABLE_POINTER`.
- `*rw T` grants **read/write capability** through that pointer.
- Multiple `*rw T` pointers may alias the exact same target allocation and perform interleaved mutations inside `unsafe` without triggering borrowck conflicts, because raw pointers are explicitly untracked.

### H.5 Raw-Derived References & Local Validity Regions
- Re-borrowing through a raw pointer (`&(*p)` or `&rw (*p)`) synthesizes a fresh reference.
- The synthesized reference's loan and lifetime are bound to the local enclosing statement or block validity region.
- Once created, the synthesized reference immediately participates in standard borrowck and must not conflict with other active safe borrows in that validity region.

### H.6 Element-Stride Pointer Arithmetic
- Offset arithmetic (`p + n`, `p - n`) scales by the stride of the pointee type:
  $$\text{OffsetBytes} = n \times \text{sizeof}(T)$$
  Lowered to LLVM `getelementptr inbounds` (GEP).
- Pointer distance subtraction (`p1 - p2`) computes the signed element count as `isize`:
  $$\text{Distance} = \frac{\text{int}(p1) - \text{int}(p2)}{\text{sizeof}(T)}$$
  Lowered via LLVM `ptrtoint` and integer subtraction with exact division, or LLVM `build_ptr_diff`.
- Pointer arithmetic on non-pointer operands or outside `unsafe` is rejected.

### H.7 Deterministic Comptime VM Traps vs Runtime Zero-Cost
1. **Comptime Sandboxed VM**:
   - The MVIR interpreter traps raw pointer violations deterministically at compile-time:
     - Null pointer dereference (`0x0`) emits `E_NULL_POINTER_DEREFERENCE`.
     - Use-after-free or dangling address dereference emits `E_USE_AFTER_FREE`.
     - Out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic or dereference emits `E_OUT_OF_BOUNDS_DEREF`.
2. **Runtime Production**:
   - Compiles to native unadorned hardware loads and stores with zero runtime check overhead, preserving optimal C-ABI foreign interoperability and high performance. Target hardware memory protection faults (e.g. SIGSEGV) trap at the CPU level.

---

## Rule I: Unsize / dyn Trait Coercion Formalization (P3)

### I.1 Core Invariant: Unsized Type Admission & Value-Position Rejection
$$\forall T \in \text{Types}, \quad \text{is\_unsized}(T) \iff T \in \{\text{dyn Trait}, [U]\}$$
$$\forall v \in \text{ValuePositions}, \quad \text{type\_of}(v) = T \land \text{is\_unsized}(T) \implies \text{Error}(\text{E\_UNSIZED\_TYPE\_IN\_VALUE\_POSITION})$$

1. **Unsized Types in Luna v1**:
   - `dyn Trait` (trait object dynamically sized type) and `[T]` (dynamically sized slice type) are unsized.
   - Luna v1 does **not** introduce an implicit `T: Sized` trait solver bound. Instead, the type checker directly rejects unsized types in all value positions:
     - Variable declarations (`dec x: dyn Trait`, `dec x: [T]`)
     - Function parameters (`fn f(x: dyn Trait)`)
     - Function return types (`fn f() -> dyn Trait`)
     - Struct field definitions (`struct S { x: dyn Trait }`)
     Any occurrence in these positions emits `E_UNSIZED_TYPE_IN_VALUE_POSITION`.
2. **Permitted Indirect Positions**:
   Unsized types may appear exclusively behind indirection:
   - `&T`, `&rw T` (safe fat references)
   - `*T`, `*rw T` (raw fat pointers)
   - `Box<T>` (heap-allocated unique ownership, subject to representation support).

### I.2 Unified Coercion Engine
$$\text{CoercionKind} \in \{\text{RefMutToShared}, \text{ArrayToSlice}, \text{ConcreteToDyn}\}$$

1. **Architectural Separation**: Subtyping/coercions and type unification remain strictly separated. The coercion engine is unified under `coercion::try_coerce(actual, expected) -> bool`, recording `CoercionKind` in `tables.coercions`.
2. **Explicit MVIR Lowering**: Coercions are explicit instructions in MVIR:
   - `ArrayToSlice`: Lowered to `Instruction::MakeSlice { data_ptr, len }`.
   - `ConcreteToDyn`: Lowered to `Instruction::MakeTraitObject { data_ptr, vtable, trait_sym, concrete_sym }`.
   - `RefMutToShared`: Lowered without runtime transformation (retaining the inner pointer).
3. **Mutability Narrowing**:
   - `&rw [T; N]` coerces to `&rw [T]` and `&[T]`.
   - `&[T; N]` coerces to `&[T]`, but coercing `&[T; N]` to `&rw [T]` is rejected.
   - `&rw T` coerces to `&rw dyn Trait` and `&dyn Trait`.
   - `&T` coerces to `&dyn Trait`, but coercing `&T` to `&rw dyn Trait` is rejected.

### I.3 Fat Pointer Representation
$$\text{Representation}(\&[T]) = \text{Representation}(*[T]) = \{ \text{data}: *T, \, \text{len}: \text{i64} \}$$
$$\text{Representation}(\&\text{dyn Trait}) = \text{Representation}(*\text{dyn Trait}) = \{ \text{data}: *\text{Void}, \, \text{vtable}: *\text{Vtable} \}$$

1. **Slice Fat Pointers**:
   A 2-word aggregate `{ data: ptr, len: i64 }`. Length represents element count (not byte count).
2. **Trait Object Fat Pointers**:
   A 2-word aggregate `{ data: ptr, vtable: ptr }`. `data` points to the concrete payload; `vtable` points to the statically initialized global vtable for that `(Trait, ConcreteType)` pair.

### I.4 Luna Trait Object ABI v1
$$\text{VtableLayout} = [ \text{drop\_glue}: *\text{Void}, \, \text{size}: \text{usize}, \, \text{align}: \text{usize}, \, \text{method}_0, \, \text{method}_1, \dots ]$$

1. **Slot Allocation**:
   - **Slot 0**: `drop_glue`. Function pointer to the concrete destructor, or `null` if the type does not implement `Drop`.
   - **Slot 1**: `size`. Size of the concrete type in bytes as a pointer-sized integer (`inttoptr`).
   - **Slot 2**: `align`. Alignment of the concrete type in bytes as a pointer-sized integer (`inttoptr`).
   - **Slot $3 + i$**: Function pointer to the $i$-th trait method, indexed in source declaration order.
2. **Destructor Execution & Null Guard**:
   - `Instruction::DropVirt { obj }` extracts `drop_glue = vtable[0]`.
   - Backend codegen emits an explicit null guard (`if drop_glue != null { call drop_glue(data); }`). If `drop_glue == null`, destructor execution is a safe no-op.
3. **Method Dispatch**:
   - `Instruction::CallVirt { obj, method_idx, args }` indexes the vtable at slot `method_idx + 3`, passing `obj.data` as receiver.

### I.5 Object Safety Specification
A trait `Trait` is object-safe (admitting `dyn Trait`) if and only if all of the following hold:
1. **No Generic Methods**: No method in `Trait` declares type parameters (`generic_params.is_empty()`).
2. **Receiver Requirement**: Every method in `Trait` has a receiver (`self`, `&self`, or `&rw self`) as its first parameter.
3. **No Unboxed Self Return**: No method in `Trait` returns unboxed `Self`.
4. **No Self in Non-Receiver Parameters**: No parameter other than the receiver references `Self`.
Violations emit `E_TRAIT_NOT_OBJECT_SAFE`.

### I.6 Frozen v1 Restrictions
1. **Single Trait Only**: `dyn Trait` admits exactly one trait name. Multi-trait composition (`dyn Foo + Bar`) is unsupported in v1.
2. **No Associated Types on dyn**: Traits declaring associated types cannot be made into trait objects (`E_DYN_ASSOCIATED_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED`).
3. **No Supertrait dyn Composition**: Traits declaring supertraits (`trait Child : Parent`) cannot be made into trait objects (`E_DYN_SUPERTRAIT_UNSUPPORTED`).
4. **No Box of Unsized**: `Box<dyn Trait>` and `Box<[T]>` are rejected in v1 with `E_UNSUPPORTED_BOX_UNSIZED`.

### I.7 Monomorphization Rooting of Dynamic Implementations
In the presence of dynamic dispatch, methods called via `CallVirt` cannot be discovered by static call-graph traversal alone.
The monomorphization engine (`MonoCollector`) roots and instantiates all methods from `impl Trait for Concrete` (and corresponding `impl Drop for Concrete`) whenever `CoercionKind::ConcreteToDyn { trait_sym, concrete_sym }` is recorded during semantic analysis.

### I.8 Entrypoint ABI Exception
The compiler-generated program entry point `main` may receive the unsized command-line argument slice `[str]` by value. This is a privileged ABI boundary; it does not generalize unsized value-position semantics to ordinary functions, bindings, structs, or returns.

---

## Rule J: Module Ancestry Visibility & Import Boundary Invariants (M1–M5)

### J.1 Core Invariant: Module Ancestry Visibility Rule
$$\forall \text{Symbol } S, \forall \text{Scope } C, \quad \text{Accessible}(S, C) \iff \text{is\_public}(S) \lor \text{enclosing\_mod}(S) = \text{enclosing\_mod}(C) \lor \text{is\_descendant}(\text{enclosing\_mod}(C), \text{enclosing\_mod}(S))$$

1. **Enclosing Module Boundary**:
   $\text{enclosing\_mod}(\sigma)$ walks up parent scopes until the first scope of kind `ScopeKind::Module` or `ScopeKind::Global` is reached.
2. **Access Invariant**:
   - A `public` (`export`) symbol is accessible everywhere within its provider and exported in cross-provider interfaces.
   - A `private` symbol is accessible:
     - Within the lexical body of its declaring module ($\text{enclosing\_mod}(S) = \text{enclosing\_mod}(C)$).
     - Within any child, grandchild, or descendant module nested inside its declaring module ($\text{is\_descendant}(\text{enclosing\_mod}(C), \text{enclosing\_mod}(S))$).
   - A `private` symbol is **strictly inaccessible** to sibling modules, parent modules, ancestor modules, or foreign providers. Violations emit `Symbol '...' is private and cannot be accessed from this scope`.

### J.2 Rule M1: Policy Disjointness of Local vs External Imports
$$\text{Domain}(\text{import } \text{"pkg"}) \cap \text{Domain}(\text{import } \langle\text{pkg}\rangle) = \emptyset$$

1. **Local Provider Resolution (`import "foo";`)**:
   Searches strictly within user-configured `search_paths` for `foo.ms` or `foo.mlib`. Never resolves against external sysroot components.
2. **External Package Resolution (`import <foo>;`)**:
   Searches strictly within `sysroot.external_dir()` and registered sysroot components. Never falls back to local `search_paths`.
3. **Cross-Contamination Prohibition**:
   No local import may silently resolve a bootstrapped external component (`core`), and no external import may silently resolve a local project file.

### J.3 Rule M2: End-to-End Declaration Container Traversal
`Decl::Module` is a structural declaration container, not merely a resolver namespace alias.
All compiler phases must recursively traverse `Decl::Module` subtrees:
1. **TypeChecker**: Traverses items in Pass 1 (nominal types), Pass 1.8 (trait impls), Pass 2 (function headers), constant initializers, and Pass 3 / `typecheck_item`.
2. **MonoCollector**: Recursively discovers and roots generic instantiations nested inside modules.
3. **MvirGenerator**: Emits MVIR function declarations and basic blocks for items inside modules.
4. **Borrowck**: Audits borrow and move semantics across all functions lowered from nested modules.

### J.4 Rule M3: Multi-Provider Namespace Aggregation
$$\text{Provider}(P_1) \cup \text{Provider}(P_2) \longrightarrow \text{Namespace}(N)$$

Per Luna Rule 7, providers and module namespaces are orthogonal:
1. Multiple providers (e.g. `alloc.ms` and `core.ms`) may contribute declarations to the same public module namespace (e.g. `module std { ... }`).
2. Provider export extraction (`extract_scope`) recurses into `SymbolKind::Module` without filtering on `provider_id`. Child declarations retain individual provider ownership.
3. Symbol injection merges contributions into existing module scopes without overwriting or discarding declarations from preceding providers.

### J.5 Rule M5: Syntax Containment & Re-Export Diagnostics
1. Luna v1 does not support re-exporting modules via imports or aliases.
2. `export using` and `export import` are strictly prohibited and must emit clear compile-time diagnostics. Neither construct may silently succeed or silently no-op.

### J.6 Negative Pipeline Invariant
$$\text{Module / Import Error} \implies \text{Diagnostic} \land \text{No Provider Corruption} \land \text{No Partial Namespace} \land \text{No MVIR} \land \text{No Backend} \land \text{No Artifact} \land \text{No Panic}$$
Any failure during module resolution, file parsing, cyclic detection, or visibility check immediately halts compilation before downstream intermediate representations are produced.

## Rule K: Surface Syntax & Grammar Authority Invariants

### K.1 Core Invariant: Grammar Authority & Isomorphism
$$\text{AST accepted by parser} \iff \text{Exactly defined by grammar.ebnf} \iff \text{Exactly supported by parser} \iff \text{No accepted syntax silently ignored}$$

The versioned Luna 0.1 syntax chapter, adopted detailed contracts, and `grammar.ebnf` define the syntax contract; `mellis-grammar` is operational guidance referencing them. No syntax may be accepted by the parser unless formalized in `grammar.ebnf`, and no accepted syntax may be silently ignored or discarded.

### K.2 Struct Field Delimiter Invariant
$$\text{struct\_body} ::= \text{"\{" } (\text{struct\_field } (\text{"," } \text{struct\_field})^* \text{","}? )? \text{ "\}"}$$

Struct fields strictly use comma `,` delimiters (`struct Point { x: f64, y: f64 };`). Semicolons `;` as struct field separators are excluded from the 0.1 standard syntax to ensure unambiguous formatting, macro expansion, and syntax tooling.

### K.3 Postfix Await Operator Invariant
$$\text{postfix\_op} ::= \dots \mid \text{"." } \text{KW\_AWAIT}$$

Luna 0.1 strictly standardizes on postfix `.await` (`expr.await`). Prefix `await expr` is forbidden to eliminate operator precedence ambiguities (e.g. `await foo().bar()`) and align with the postfix member-access hierarchy (`.field`, `.method()`, `[i]`, `.await`).

### K.4 Dual Loop Invariant (Foreach & C-style)
Luna supports two complementary loop constructs:
1. **Foreach Loop**: `for ( <pattern> in <expression> ) block_stmt`
2. **C-style Index Loop**: `for ( <for_init>? ; <expression>? ; <expression>? ) block_stmt`
The two loop forms have disjoint syntactic heads and are parsed without ambiguous heuristics.

### K.5 Method Receiver Equivalence Invariant
The canonical method receiver shorthands have strict, bidirectional semantic equivalence with their explicit forms:

$$\&self \equiv self : \&Self$$
$$\&rw \text{ } self \equiv self : \&rw \text{ } Self$$
$$self \equiv self : Self$$

No compiler phase or analysis pass may exhibit semantic divergence between canonical shorthand and explicit forms.

### K.6 Provider vs Module Namespace Orthogonality
$$\text{Provider(Artifact/File)} \ne \text{Namespace(Module)}$$

1. `import "foo";` and `import <foo>;` reference **providers** (artifact or file names without extensions). They do not bring symbols into scope and do not define namespaces.
2. `module foo { ... }` declares an inline **namespace / declaration container** within a provider file. File-level `module foo;` is forbidden.
3. Symbols are accessed via namespace paths (`geometry::Point`), never provider names. Multiple providers may contribute declarations to the same namespace.

### K.7 Namespace Alias Invariant
$$\text{using\_decl} ::= \text{"using" } \text{module\_path } \text{"as" } \text{IDENTIFIER } \text{";"}$$

`using` creates a compilation-local alias to a qualified module namespace path. It does not export (`export using` is a syntax error), does not glob, and does not load providers.


## Adopted amendments and current gaps

Visibility-02 independently declares unmodified fields public, export fields public, and private fields private; containing type accessibility is checked first. The approved amendment supersedes older field-private-default guidance.

Rule K.4 retains the parenthesized foreach contract; the current parser uses an unparenthesized head. Rule K.5 shorthand equivalence remains required even where implementation evidence is incomplete. Struct field semicolons currently parse despite Rule K.2. These are tracked in the 0.1 gap register, not resolved by weakening this document.

The consolidated EBNF is explicitly incomplete; K.1 is a target conformance invariant, not a claim that the current grammar and parser are already isomorphic.
